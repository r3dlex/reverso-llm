# Architecture Sketch
## Reverso Gateway

**Document version.** 0.2 (draft)

**Companion documents.** `01-brd.md`, `02-prd.md`, `04-mvp.md`.

**Scope.** Component-level architecture. Not code. Identifies the major modules, their responsibilities, their interfaces, and the runtime topology. Stack-specific (Python + LiteLLM + asyncio) but at the level of "what subprocesses run where," not "what classes have what methods."

---

## 1. Runtime Topology

Two long-lived processes per Reverso installation:

```

```

**LiteLLM process.** Hosts the inbound HTTP API on `127.0.0.1:64946`. Handles request parsing, body translation between OpenAI and Anthropic shapes, response streaming. Loads `models.yaml` and uses it as its `model_list`. Custom providers route subprocess-backed models to the session daemon.

**Session daemon process.** Owns all wrapped CLI subprocesses. Maintains session table. Implements session lifecycle (spawn, turn, idle detection, recycle). Exposes a small internal HTTP API over a Unix-domain socket. Not exposed on TCP at all.

The two processes communicate over a Unix-domain socket at `~/Library/application support/reverso/daemon.sock`. The session daemon has no TCP listener. This means:

- Only processes running as the same user as the daemon can talk to it.
- It is trivially impossible to expose the daemon to the network even by misconfiguration.
- The LiteLLM custom provider uses `httpx` with a `transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(uds=...)` to call the daemon.

## 2. Component Inventory

### 2.1 LiteLLM proxy (Process 1)

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| LiteLLM core | Inbound HTTP server, model_list routing, body translation, streaming bridge |
| `models.yaml` loader | Parsed once at startup, expanded into LiteLLM's `model_list` |
| `anthropic_cli_provider.py` | LiteLLM custom provider; forwards Anthropic-backend requests to the session daemon |
| `openai_cli_provider.py` | LiteLLM custom provider; forwards OpenAI-backend requests to the session daemon |
| HTTP-forwarded provider | Standard LiteLLM behavior for DeepSeek (no custom code) |
| `x_gateway` injector | Middleware that wraps responses to add the `x_gateway` envelope |

### 2.2 Session daemon (Process 2)

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Internal HTTP server | Accepts `POST /session/turn` from LiteLLM custom providers over UDS |
| Session table | In-memory dict mapping (machine, workspace, provider) to Session object |
| Session lifecycle | Spawn, turn execution, idle detection, recycle |
| Subprocess manager | Owns wrapped CLI processes via `asyncio.subprocess` |
| Output parser | Per-CLI module that extracts assistant text and tool-call events from CLI output |
| Recycle sweeper | `asyncio` task running every 60 minutes; checks idle conditions, terminates stale sessions |
| Workspace conflict detector | Scans for other `claude`/`codex` processes at session spawn; emits warnings |
| `x_gateway` data producer | Constructs observation objects from parsed tool-call events |

## 3. Request Flow

### 3.1 Wrapped-CLI request (subscription-backed)

1. Client sends `POST /v1/chat/completions` to `127.0.0.1:64946` with body `{model: "claude-sonnet-4-5", messages: [...], x_gateway: {workspace: "/Users/andre/Ws/foo"}}`.
2. LiteLLM parses the request, looks up `claude-sonnet-4-5` in `model_list`, sees it routes to the custom provider `anthropic_cli_provider`.
3. The custom provider extracts the latest user message and workspace, calls the session daemon over UDS: `POST /session/turn {workspace: "/Users/andre/Ws/foo", provider: "anthropic", user_message: "..."}`.
4. The session daemon computes the session key `(machine, "/Users/andre/Ws/foo", "anthropic")`, looks it up in its session table.
5. If no session exists: spawn a new wrapped Claude Code subprocess in the workspace directory, store it in the session table.
6. If session exists: use the existing subprocess.
7. The daemon writes the user message to the subprocess (via stdin or the CLI's prompt mechanism, whichever Phase 0 determines is viable).
8. The daemon's output parser reads the subprocess's stdout incrementally, identifying:
   - Tool-call events (recorded as observations).
   - The final assistant text.
9. When the turn completes, the daemon returns `{assistant_text: "...", observations: [...]}` to the custom provider.
10. The custom provider constructs an OpenAI Chat Completions response shape with the assistant text and adds the `x_gateway` envelope (session_id, observations, etc.).
11. LiteLLM returns the response to the client.

### 3.2 HTTP-forwarded request (DeepSeek)

1. Client sends `POST /v1/chat/completions` with `model: "deepseek-reasoner"`.
2. LiteLLM looks up the model, sees it routes to the native LiteLLM DeepSeek backend.
3. LiteLLM forwards the request to `api.deepseek.com`, with the API key injected from env (which the gateway populated at startup from Keychain).
4. LiteLLM receives the response, applies any necessary body translation if the inbound surface was Anthropic-shape.
5. The `x_gateway` injector adds the envelope (session_id null, observations empty, provider set to deepseek).
6. LiteLLM returns the response.

### 3.3 Streaming

Both flows above support streaming. The wrapped-CLI flow requires the daemon to emit chunks as the wrapped CLI produces output, the custom provider to relay them as a generator into LiteLLM's streaming pipeline, and LiteLLM to forward them as SSE to the client. The HTTP-forwarded flow uses LiteLLM's existing streaming relay unchanged.

## 4. Session State Model

### 4.1 In-memory session table

```python
# Conceptual shape, not literal code:
{
    ("mac-mini-andre", "/Users/andre/Ws/foo", "anthropic"): Session(
        process=<subprocess.Process>,
        spawned_at=<datetime>,
        last_request_at=<datetime>,
        turn_count=42,
        ...
    ),
    ("mac-mini-andre", "/Users/andre/Ws/bar", "openai"): Session(...),
}
```

### 4.2 Idle detection

The recycle sweeper, on each tick, for each session in the table:

1. Computes minutes since `last_request_at`. If less than 30, skip (not idle).
2. Walks the process tree of the wrapped CLI subprocess (via `psutil`). If any descendant is alive, skip (per Q3-(ii): live children keep the session warm).
3. Otherwise, mark for recycle. Send SIGTERM to the wrapped CLI. Wait 5 seconds. SIGKILL if still alive. Remove from session table.

### 4.3 No persistence

The session table is in-memory only. Gateway restart loses everything. This is the locked-in behavior from Q5.

## 5. Tool-Use Interception Detail

### 5.1 What the daemon parses

When the wrapped CLI runs a tool (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.), it emits structured output that the daemon's per-CLI parser must recognize. Examples of what to look for (subject to Phase 0 validation):

- Claude Code in non-interactive mode emits tool-call JSON blocks delimited by recognizable markers, or emits a structured output format when invoked with appropriate flags.
- Codex CLI may emit similar structured output or may require parsing of its TUI rendering.

The parser's job is to identify, for each tool the CLI ran:
- The tool name.
- The arguments (as a JSON object).
- A short result indicator (success/failure + maybe a length or error string).
- The elapsed time.

This is the most fragile component in the system. It depends on the CLIs' output format, which is upstream-controlled and not contractually stable.

### 5.2 Inbound tool declaration translation

When the inbound request includes a `tools` array (declaring tools the model could call):

1. The daemon attempts to map each inbound tool to a wrapped-CLI native tool by name + schema similarity.
2. Mappings that succeed are noted; the wrapped CLI will use its native equivalent when the model asks for a mapped tool.
3. Mappings that fail are dropped. The dropped names are added to `x_gateway.warnings` in the response.

This mapping is data-driven, defined per-provider in a `tool_mappings.yaml` file. v1 ships with a small initial set covering the most common tools (file read, file edit, shell).

## 6. Configuration and Secrets

### 6.1 Configuration files (committed to git)

- `models.yaml` - model registry (per Q13).
- `config.yaml` - runtime config (paths, timeouts, ports).
- `tool_mappings.yaml` - inbound-tool to CLI-tool mapping.

### 6.2 Secrets (not in git)

Stored in macOS Keychain under the namespace `reverso/<KEY_NAME>`:

- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- No Anthropic or OpenAI keys are needed; the wrapped CLIs authenticate via their own ChatGPT/Claude subscription tokens.

Both processes (LiteLLM and the session daemon) read Keychain on startup via the `security` CLI, populate env vars, and pass them to upstream HTTP calls.

## 7. Deployment Topology

### 7.1 Two launchd LaunchAgents

`com.user.reverso-daemon.plist` - Session daemon. Starts first, listens on the UDS.

`com.user.reverso-proxy.plist` - LiteLLM proxy. Starts independently on loopback. When the daemon transport is unavailable, times out, or closes unexpectedly, wrapped-CLI providers record a warning and degrade to a stateless one-turn CLI subprocess so local Codex profiles keep working; session continuity is cold for that turn. Daemon HTTP status errors are surfaced and are not masked by stateless fallback.

Both run under the developer's user account, both restart on crash via launchd's `KeepAlive`, both log to `~/Library/Logs/reverso/`.

## 8. Failure Modes and Recovery

| Failure | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Wrapped CLI crashes mid-turn | Subprocess exits before assistant text complete | Return HTTP 500 with populated observations; remove session from table |
| Session daemon transport unavailable | LiteLLM custom provider gets UDS connection, timeout, or remote protocol error | Provider records a warning, runs one stateless CLI turn when the CLI binary is available, and launchd restarts the daemon; session continuity is cold for that degraded turn. Daemon HTTP status errors are surfaced. |
| LiteLLM crashes | launchd notices process exit | launchd restarts; daemon is unaffected; existing sessions remain alive |
| Workspace path invalid | Validated at request time | HTTP 400 returned to client; no session created |
| Two requests for same session arrive concurrently | Session daemon detects via per-session asyncio lock | Second request blocks until first completes; daemon processes serially per session |
| Models.yaml malformed | Validated at startup | LiteLLM fails to start; launchd retries with backoff; logs explain the parse error |
| Keychain missing required secret | Validated at startup | Daemon emits warning, marks the affected provider as unavailable; requests for that provider return HTTP 503 |
| Wrapped CLI hangs (no output for N minutes) | Per-turn timeout (default 5 minutes) | Daemon sends SIGTERM to subprocess; returns HTTP 504; session removed from table |

## 9. Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Target | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Cold-start session latency overhead | < 10 seconds | Wrapped CLI spawn + first-token time |
| Warm-session per-turn latency overhead | < 200 ms | Daemon dispatch + parser + envelope construction |
| Throughput | 4 concurrent sessions on Mac mini | One core per active wrapped CLI is generous |
| Memory at rest | < 200 MB | LiteLLM ~100 MB, daemon ~50 MB |
| Memory per active session | wrapped CLI footprint + 50 MB | Daemon-side overhead is modest |
| Restart time | < 10 seconds | Both processes warm-start quickly |

## 10. v2 Considerations (deliberately out of scope for v1)

These are explicitly deferred but worth noting so v1 design choices accommodate them where free to do so:

- **Multi-machine deployment.** The machine dimension of the session key is already reserved.
- **Session forking.** The `x_gateway.session_tag` extension field is reserved in the response envelope; v1 always sets it to null.
- **Hot-reload of models.yaml.** Possible via SIGHUP; v1 requires restart.
- **Tool execution mediation (IV-strict).** v1 is IV-pragmatic; v2 could intercept and require client approval before tool execution if the wrapped CLIs gain support for this mode.
- **Token usage accounting.** Either via wrapped CLI cooperation or via tiktoken-based estimation.
- **Authentication for tunnel access.** A v2 concern paired with multi-machine; not relevant for v1.
- **An Elixir/Phoenix rewrite if maintenance burden grows.** The architecture maps cleanly. Daemon to GenServer-per-session under Supervisor. UDS to Phoenix endpoint on a different port. The model registry, configuration, operational scripts, and overall design transfer intact.
