# GitHub Branch Policy Checklist - reverso

This is a checklist artifact per the AI SDLC ci-policy module. It documents the intended branch protection for `main`. Nothing here mutates GitHub settings; applying a ruleset is a deliberate admin action by the owner.

## Target

- Protected branch: `main`
- Enforcement state: checklist-only (no ruleset or classic protection applied yet)
- Owner: repository admin (andre.burgstahler)

## Required before merge

- [ ] Pull request required before merging (no direct pushes to `main`)
- [ ] Required status checks (GitHub-hosted legs only):
  - [ ] `Pre-commit Hooks` (ci-prek.yml, hosted leg)
  - [ ] `test (3.12)` (ci.yml)
  - [ ] `test (gate)` (ci.yml)
- [ ] Required approvals: 1 (single-maintainer repo; the AI review loop below substitutes for a second human)
- [ ] Dismiss stale approvals on new commits: enabled

## Explicitly NOT required

- `Pre-commit Hooks (self-hosted)`: permanently broken on the self-hosted runner (missing libpython3.11). Informational only; never mark as required.
- `test (self-hosted) (3.12)`: redundant with the hosted leg; informational only.

## Optional hardening (decide later)

- [ ] Require linear history (current practice is squash-merge, so history is already linear)
- [ ] Require signed commits
- [ ] Merge queue (overkill for a single-maintainer repo)
- [ ] Tag protection ruleset for `v*` (see `docs/agents/release-versioning-github.md`)

## PR merge gate (AI SDLC)

Merge is allowed only when all of these are true:

1. The **architect** confirms the PR still matches ADRs (`docs/architecture/adr/`), module boundaries (frozen `ProviderAdapter` Protocol, replay seam ownership), branch policy, and acceptance criteria.
2. The **reviewer** confirms code quality, safety, documentation, and drift checks have no blocking findings.
3. The **executor** confirms the requested change is complete, cleanup is done, and the required hosted checks are green.
4. The architect, reviewer, and executor loop reaches explicit agreement. If any role disagrees or required checks are not green, do not merge.
