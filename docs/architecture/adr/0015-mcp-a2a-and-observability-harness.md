# ADR 0015: MCP/A2A open standards and an observability harness surface

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

The init-ai-repo v3 governance standard treats observability (logs, traces,
eval/cost/latency metering) as non-optional harness surface - without it there is
no way to tell whether an agent is doing well or quietly drifting. It also
recommends adopting open standards now: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool
access and Agent2Agent (A2A) for cross-agent delegation. Prior to this upgrade,
`reverso` had no governance-level observability surface and no MCP/A2A surface.

The `AGENTS.md` Harness Map enumerates six context types and documents the
static-vs-dynamic context boundary as a reviewed, versioned decision.

## Decision

- Generate an **observability** surface: `.ai/observability/conventions.md`
  (logging and trace conventions) and `.ai/observability/audit-checklist.md`
  (token-cost and trajectory-audit checklist). These are generated conventions
  and a checklist, not live metering - token-cost and trajectory metering execute
  out-of-band and are recorded as evidence; CI validates only that the
  conventions and checklist exist.
- Promote **MCP/A2A** from a mention to a real surface: `.ai/mcp/registry.json`
  (MCP-server registry stub - `status: "stub"`, no live endpoint resolved) and
  `.ai/mcp/a2a-handoff.md` (A2A cross-agent handoff convention). Generation makes
  no network or model call.
- `AGENTS.md` carries an explicit **Harness Map** enumerating the six context
  types and documents the static-vs-dynamic context boundary as a reviewed,
  versioned architectural decision.

## Consequences

- Agent drift, cost, and trajectory become auditable; supports the model-routing
  audit defined in ADR-0013.
- Choosing MCP/A2A now preserves multi-vendor/framework optionality and avoids
  re-platforming later.
- The static/dynamic context boundary becomes a first-class architectural
  decision rather than an implicit one; moving a context type across it requires
  an ADR update.
- CI validates only that the generated conventions and checklist exist
  (offline-structural check); it never runs a live model or network call.

## Verification

- `.ai/observability/conventions.md` and `.ai/observability/audit-checklist.md`
  exist and are non-empty.
- `.ai/mcp/registry.json` parses and declares only `status: "stub"` servers with
  `endpoint: null`.
- `.ai/mcp/a2a-handoff.md` defines the handoff envelope and rules.
